<!-- In dom we use to work on console and if we want to see
  anythong related to a site or website then for example we 
  want to find the element by name then document.getElementById('title')
  if we want to find something by id then document.getElementById('title').id
  if we want to find class then find it by using classname istead of id
  document.getElementById('title').classname we can also get the attribute by using 
  document.getElementById('title').getAttribute('can be => class, id')
  we can also set the attribute by which we can overwrite the attribute
  document.getElementById('title').setAttribute('class', 'test') this syntax means
  in class attribute whatever written is overwrite by test....
  we can store variable by{ const title =  document.getElementById('title')}
  now we store it so we can also edit it and insrert new things into it
  as like we use [style] in html to give a color like style = "color: blue"
  title.style.backgroundcolor = 'green' also change the padding
  title.style.padding = "15px" , title.style.borderRadius = "15px"
   we can also get the text content by using title.textContent or title.innerHTML
   or title.innertext but there is a difference between them also as idf 
   we use span and add some new code and print then 
   title.innercontent gives the full text and innertext does not give
   in inner.HTML it gives each and everything written in the code
   we can get too many things by using different libraries like
   document.getElementByClassName('any classname') we can get the 
   whole line code by using document.querySelector('h2') and
   document.querySelector('#title') and document.querySelector('.heading')
   we can also use it for password like document.querySelector('input[type="password"]')
   we can any css selector by us eof queryselector also find the first child
   document.querySelector('p:first-child')....

   if we want to vhange something in list so we can change it on 
   console like use syntax document.querySelector('ul') by this we can easily change the color of
   any type of list by writting this document.querySelector('ul') we
   select whole unordered list then after it save it in a variable
   const myul = document.querySelector('ul') then after it go and select the list
   by using syntax myul.document.querySelector('li') 

   now the font is not has any color and we want to turn it into some
   color like green so we use to first store it in a variable
   const turngreen = myul.document.querySelector('li') 
   turngreen.style.backgroundcolor = "green" we can also change its padding
   by turngreen.style.padding = "15px"
   we can also get what turns green means html code by using innerHTML
   or change the text by using turngreen.innertext= "five";
   in ul list are listed is in the form of type of array but "{not array}"
   sometimes it works like same for example if we use this document.querySelector('li')
   and then see NodeList[] we can also change the things by going into it but
   it is not array change by doing{lecture dekh lena at 25 : 00 se}
   there are two different things nodelist and array in which we have map in array 
   but not in nodelist kahi hadd tak dono same hote hai but same nhi haote 
   remember the thing we can change the color of the list by using tempL1List.style.color = 'green'
   but before that we have to initialsie the temp list by using {{document.querySelectorAll('li')}}
   and then can find them with their indexing as if i want to change the clor of 
   1st index then tempL1List[1].style.color = 'green';
   example below:=>
   const myh1 = document.querySelectorAll('h1')
   press enter see undefined 
   myh1.style.color = 'green'
   myh1[0].style.color = 'green'

   we can use foreach() here for coloring each and every list for example there  is a list
   tempL1List.foreach(function (l) {
   l.style.backgroundColor = 'green'
   })

    now we are going to use getElementByclassName
    agr mujhe saari list laake do jisme class lagi ho "list-item"
    then mujhe karna padega document.getElementsByClassName('list-item')
     
    we can only use for each when the type is arrya because in array there 
    is map and in nodelist there is no map se we can not us efor each there
    so for using it we have to convert nodelist into array for that we do
    Array.from(tempClassList) after this it converts into array and map
    is available at that time
