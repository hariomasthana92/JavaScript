//javascript execution context

// there are three context but mainly are 1st two;
//1*global execution context
//2*function execution context;
//3*eval execution context;

// {inside any code}-> memry creation phase

// memory phase -> val1 = undefined, val2 = undefined , addnum = definition
// result1 = undefined , result2 = undefined

 //execution phase => by which we execute the whole code in a given programme;

 // after execution the executed result deleted;

 // call stack
 //in call stack there is a stack in which all the programmes run sunder the global execution
 // each and every function come executes and go
 //if there is nested function then we use lifo
 //by which last executed function goes first after execution

// this example shows the lifo
//  function one(){
//     console.log("one");
// }
// function two(){
//     console.log("two");
// }
// function three(){
//     console.log("three");
// }
// one(two(three()))
